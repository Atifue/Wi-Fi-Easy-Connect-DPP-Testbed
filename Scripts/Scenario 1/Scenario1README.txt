Scenario1README

This Scenario is a completely local variant, meant to show DPP how it is explained in the specification. Because there are currently few implementations for Smartphones the Configurator is a NUC (Linux Ubuntu) with a webcam attached to read QR Codes. Please read instructions to use the scripts.

Packages that need to be installed:
xxd, qrencode, python3 (pip: cv2 pyzbar, os), dnsmasq, hostapd, wpa_supplicant, openssl
