3rd Week Notes:

0.1. Edit the scripts so they fit your interfaces, MAC adresses etc... also I renamed my compiled versions of hotapd 'hostapd-dpp' and of wpa_supplicant 'wpa_supplicant-dpp'. 

1. Script CrPrKey.sh on each role

On Enrolle:
2. Start Script Enrollee, if something fails -> ip link set interface down/up, pkill wpa_supplicant (check if station mode)
3. Copy URI and transfer to configurator system

On AP:
4. Start/Edit Script AccesPoint, if something fails -> Interface down/up, check if __ap mode for if. pkill hostapd (make sure to memorize the right SSID)
5. Copy URI and transfer to configurator system

On Configurator:
(Don't forget to run the PrivateKey script for Configurator)
6. Start Configurator Script, if something fails -> check wpa_supplicant Error routine as above (station mode)
7. Follow the script
8. When AP Script is done, Connection was successful

See config screenshots for configs that work for hostapd and wpa_supplicant

When you retry the process, you have to change the SSID since there won't be a handshake because the STA remembers the network.
