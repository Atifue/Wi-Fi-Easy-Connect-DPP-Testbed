Scenario3 Describes the case, That there are 2 Devices involved:
Acces Point that is also the Configurator (NUC1), STA (Raspy)
The Accesspoint also hosts a http server with a script where you can upload the bootstrapping keys, simulating a cloud service.


install lighttpd
copy lighttpd config to /etc/lighttpd/
copy store.py and confirm_store.py to /var/www/html/cgi-bin/

install dnsmasq
dnsmasq.conf goes to /etc/

other config files -> /etc/dpp/*.conf

Once: CrPrKey for Configurator and AP
Edit file "StartAccesPoint" -> correct ssid, mac adress, interface
Start "StartAccesPoint.sh"
Edit file "StartConfigurator" -> correct ssid, mac adress, interface
Start "StartConfigurator.sh"


Keys can be added via

Note: Due to the Error an extra Configurator Device is needed. For convenience we chose the same device, but a different wifi chip. Check Scenario 2 if you have seperate devices.
