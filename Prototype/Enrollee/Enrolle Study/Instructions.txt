Instructions:
(Raspberry Pi with ALFA Wifi Adapter)
Get Internet Access
Copy scripts to Desktop
Adjust wifi interfaces + mac adresses in scripts
Copy dpp.conf to /etc/dpp/dpp.conf
Adjust Paths in Scripts to /home/$YOURUSER/Desktop/$SCRIPT_XY

Do: 
setup.sh
CrPrKey.sh
StartDppEnrollee.sh
-> Install Packages if I missed some in setup.sh
-> Copy Bootstrapping Key and print QRCode

Do:
sudo crontab -e
add:
@reboot echo none | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/ACT/trigger #Start Controlling the LED of the Raspi
@reboot echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/ACT/brightness #Turn Off light
@reboot /home/$YOURUSER/Desktop/StartDppEnrollee.sh #Start DPP Listen

-> setup is complete. Every reboot device is ready for connection

Note: Currently configured for deleting old network information. If not wanted delete refresh.sh in StartDppEnrollee.sh
Blink.sh is only for controlling the LED and give feedback if EAPOL Handshake worked. Blink.sh is called at the end of StartDPPEnrollee.sh
